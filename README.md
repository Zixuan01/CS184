The goal of the project is to build an app to help people to keep track of their expenses because similar existing apps out there are either too difficult to use or let users lose interest in creating habits to manage their money. We hope to create an app with simple and easy-to-use features such that users do not have to spend a lot of time learning how to use the app and simplify the tasks that the users have to do to document their income or expenses. Most importantly, the app will remind and motivate users to be consistent with money management through fun interactions and activities.
